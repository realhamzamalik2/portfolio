## About Page

### Personal Story
Growing up with a passion for technology in Pakistan, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science with distinction. Driven by the desire to work with cutting-edge AI technology, I chose South Korea - a global leader in technological innovation - for my advanced studies.

This transition from Pakistan to Korea represents not just a geographical move, but an important step in my professional growth. Here, I've had the opportunity to work with advanced AI technologies and contribute to meaningful research in computer vision, while experiencing the unique blend of innovation and efficiency that characterizes Korean tech culture.

At Seoul National University of Science and Technology's HCIR Lab, I've been able to pursue my passion for AI and computer vision, working on projects that bridge theoretical research with practical applications. This journey has shaped my approach to technology, combining diverse perspectives with technical expertise.
